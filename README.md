### Hello, my name is Edie Grove, AKA Instant or InstantDoodles
### Pronouns: She/her or They/them, no preference
### (Not really sure how this works to be honest)
### Much better at the artistic aspects of game design than the technical (ie., coding)
### I'm currently interested in the games Slay The Princess and Inscryption, and the music artist Chonny Jash.
### Hope you have a good day :)
